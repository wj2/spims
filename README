Extract all of the files to some directory and cd to that 
directory. 

The program is then called with the command 

    ./spims -p <input1> -s <input2>

where

    <input1> is the name of an existing file in JPEG, PNG, or
    GIF format without animation (the "pattern image")

    <input2> is the name of an existing file in JPEG, PNG, or
    GIF format without animation (the "source image")

or using the flag -pdir in place of -p where
   
   <input1> is a completely flat directory containing only
   JPG, GIF, or PNG image files to be used as the "pattern"
   images

or using the flag -sdir in place of -s where

   <input2> is a completely flat directory containing only 
   JPG, GIF, or PNG image files to be used as the "source"
   images

If the program finds a match, it will print a line in the format
of the following to standard out

   <file1> matches <file2> at <m1>x<n1>+<x>+<y> 

where

    <file1> is the short name (without the name of its enclosing
    directory, et cetera) of the pattern image

    <file2> is the short name (without the name of its enclosing
    directory, et cetera) of the matching source image

    <m1> is the width of the subimage that matches <file1>
    (which should be the same as the width of the pattern image)

    <n1> is the height of the subimage that matches <file1>
    (which should be the same as the height of the pattern image)

    <x> is the horizontal offset of the top left corner of that
    subimage from the top left corner of the source image

    <y> is the vertical offset of the top left corner of that
    subimage from the top left corner of the source image

Any errors produced by the software will go to standard error.
